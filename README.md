# Lab 8 - Starter
1. Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.
   - Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed 
   - So we will never forget to run those tests and we can still run those tests manually in local.
2. Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? (yes/no)
   - No, we should use a unit test for that instead.
